# Keylogger Project

## Overview

This keylogger is a simple Python-based application that captures and logs keystrokes on a user's system. It is intended for educational purposes only, and should only be used with the explicit permission of the system owner. 

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes, including special keys (like space, enter, etc.).
- Saves logs to a uniquely named text file based on the timestamp of execution.
- Provides a clean exit option by pressing the `Escape` key.

## Ethical Considerations

- This keylogger is intended for educational purposes only. 
- Always obtain explicit permission from the owner of the system before monitoring or logging keystrokes. 
- Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. 
- Use this code responsibly and in compliance with local laws and regulations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

You can install the `pynput` library using pip:

```bash
pip install pynput

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone git@github.com:ayshacybertech/PRODIGY_CS_04.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd PRODIGY_CS_04

Run the keylogger:
python3 keylogger.py
To stop the keylogger, press the Escape key.

Log Files
All keystrokes will be saved in a text file named keylog_<timestamp>.txt in the project directory. You can view this file to see the logged keystrokes.
